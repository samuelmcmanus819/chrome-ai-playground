The Extension may request specific permissions to enhance its functionality. These permissions are strictly used to enable the features of the Extension and not for any other purpose. For example, permissions like "access to tabs" are solely for processing data locally.
# 5. Security
The Extension is designed with your security in mind. Since all data processing occurs locally on your device, risks associated with external breaches or data leaks are minimized.
